//! Messages passed between agave and an external pack process.
//! Messages are passed via `shaq` SPSC and MPMC queues.
//!
//! Memory freeing is responsibility of the external pack process,
//! and is done via `rts-alloc` crate. It is also possible the external
//! pack process allocates memory to pass to agave, BUT it will still be
//! the responsibility of the external pack process to free that memory.
//!
//! Setting up the shared memory allocator and queues is done outside of
//! agave - it can be done by the external pack process or another
//! process. agave will just `join` shared memory regions, but not
//! create them.
//! Similarly, agave will not delete files used for shared memory regions.
//! See `shaq` and `rts-alloc` crates for details.
//!
//! The basic architecture is as follows:
//!        ┌───────────────┐       ┌─────────────────┐
//!        │  tpu_to_pack  │       │ progress_tracker│
//!        └───────┬───────┘       └───────┬─────────┘
//!                │                       │

//!                │                       │
//!             ┌──▼───────────────────────▼───┐
//!             │  external scheduler          │
//!             └─▲─────── ▲────────────────▲──┘

//!
//! - [`TpuToPackMessage`] are sent from `tpu_to_pack` queue to the
//!   external scheduler process. This passes in tpu transactions to be scheduled,
//!   and optionally vote transactions.
//! - [`ProgressMessage`] are sent from `progress_tracker` queue to the
//!   external scheduler process. This passes information about leader status
//!   and slot progress to the external scheduler process.
//! - [`PackToExecutionWorkerMessage`] are sent from the external scheduler process
//!   to execution worker threads within agave. This passes a batch of
//!   transactions to be executed by the worker threads.
//! - [`ExecutionWorkerToPackMessage`] are sent from execution worker threads
//!   within agave back to the external scheduler process. This passes back the
//!   results of executing the transactions.
//! - [`PackToCheckWorkerMessage`] are sent from the external scheduler process to
//!   check worker threads within agave. This passes a batch of transactions to be
//!   checked by the worker threads.
//! - [`CheckWorkerToPackMessage`] are sent from check worker threads within agave
//!   back to the external scheduler process. This passes back the results of
//!   checking the transactions.
//!
//! Ownership and pointer lifetime rule:
//! - Sending a message that contains offsets or pointers to memory transfers
//!   ownership of that memory to the receiver for the lifetime defined by the
//!   protocol.
//! - The sender must treat that memory as not owned until ownership is
//!   explicitly returned by a later message, if any. In particular, the sender
//!   must not free or modify that memory while it is not owned.
//! - If the protocol does not return the memory to the sender, the receiver is
//!   responsible for freeing it.
